The basic units of regional self-government are the counties
 (županija in Croatian). The present administrative territorial
 division of the country was introduced in 1997, when the 1992
 division was changed. Smaller administrative territorial units 
 within counties are cities/towns in urban areas, and municipalities 
 in other areas. According to the 2006 Act, Croatia has 127 towns/cities and 
 429 municipalities.

 <br/>
 <br/>
 
 The county, as a unit of territorial division in Croatia, has a 
 long history. Counties are mentioned as early as the 10th century, 
 first in the southern part of the country, and later in the north. They 
 continued to exist up to the 20th century, in different numbers and with 
 changing territorial ranges, means of organisation and powers. After the 
 demilitarisation of the Military Border in 1881, there were 8 counties in the 
 Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia: Modruš-Rijeka, Lika-Krbava, Zagreb, Varaždin, 
 Bjelovar-Križevac, Požega, Virovitica and Srijem.

 <br/>
 <br/>
 
 
 County assembly (Croatian: županijska skupština) is a representative and deliberative body in each county. Assembly members are elected for a four-year term by popular vote (proportional system with closed lists and d'Hondt method) in local elections.



In each county exists a State Administration Office (Croatian: Ured državne uprave) which performs the tasks of the central government (under Ministry of Public Administration). Head of State Administration Office (predstojnik Ureda državne uprave), who is a university graduate in law, is appointed by the Croatian Government (in the City of Zagreb the mayor is responsible for the state administration).These offices ("administrations") are not subordinate to the county assembly or county prefect, but rather the direct presence of the state (similar to governorates or prefectures in certain countries).  

<br/>
<br/>


The executive branch of each county's government is headed by a county
 prefect (county president) (Croatian: župan), except that a mayor heads the 
 city of Zagreb's executive branch. Croatia's county prefects (with two deputy prefects), 
 mayor of Zagreb (with two deputy mayors) are elected for a four-year term by a majority 
 of votes cast within applicable local government units, with a runoff election if no 
 candidate achieves a majority in the first round of voting 
 (majoritarian vote, two-round system). County prefects 
 (with deputy prefects and mayor of Zagreb with his/her deputies) can 
 be recalled by a referendum. County administrative bodies are administrative
 departments and services which are established for the performance of works in 
 the self-governing domain of the county, as well as for the performance of works 
 of state administration transferred to the county. Administrative departments and 
 services are managed by heads (principals) nominated by the county prefect on the 
 basis of a public competition.

 Croatia was first subdivided into counties in the Middle Ages.
 Counties were first introduced in Croatia during the House of Trpimirović's rule. 
 The exact number and borders of these early counties are difficult to determine accurately; 
 they were considered to encompass areas subordinated to a single centre of local authority, 
 but the possessions of significant nobles had a legal status separate from local authority. 
 
<br/>
<br/>

The traditional division of Croatia into counties was abolished in 1922, 
when the oblasts of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes were introduced; 
these were later replaced by the banovinas of Yugoslavia. Socialist Republic of Croatia, 
as a constituent part of post-World War II Yugoslavia had approximately 100 
municipalities as main governmental units and local government entities. The 
counties were reintroduced in 1992, but with significant territorial alterations 
from the pre-1922 subdivisions; for instance, before 1922 Transleithanian Croatia was 
divided into eight counties, but the new legislation established fourteen counties in 
the same territory. Međimurje County was established in the eponymous region acquired 
through the 1920 Treaty of Trianon. The county borders have sometimes changed 
since their 1992 restoration (for reasons such as historical ties and requests by cities); 
the latest revision took place in 2006.

In the 19th century, the Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas brought upon numerous 
political changes and introduced a civic government of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia as 
part of Austria-Hungary, which in turn proceeded to absorb the Croatian and Slavonian Military 
Frontiers in 1881. During the second half of the 19th century Croatian counties went through various 
reorganizations (1848-1850, 1850-1854, 1854-1861, 1861-1870, 1870-1874, 1874-1886, 1886-1914) that also 
reflected the position of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia within the Austrian Empire 
(after 1867 the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy); the last major reorganisation of the counties 
was in 1886, when eight counties were established within the kingdom. This layout largely 
remained in effect until the Croatian counties were abolished in 1922, while some 
minor adjustments of county boundaries happened in 1913. The counties were set up as 
self-governmental units in contrast to earlier county incarnations since the Middle Ages. 

<br/>
<br/>

Today's counties correspond to tier three of the European Union (EU) Nomenclature of 
Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) division of Croatia. The NUTS Local Administrative 
Unit (LAU) divisions are two-tiered; the LAU 1 divisions for Croatia also match the counties 
(in effect making these the same as the NUTS 3 units).
