<h1 class ="bg-light">Croatian Language</h1>

<p>Croatian is the standardized variety of the Serbo-Croatian
 language used by Croats, principally in Croatia, Bosnia and
 Herzegovina, the Serbian province of Vojvodina, and other 
 neighboring countries. It is the official and literary 
 standard of Croatia and one of the official languages of 
 the European Union. Croatian is also one of the official 
 languages of Bosnia and Herzegovina and a recognized minority 
 language in Serbia and neighboring countries. </p>


<p>Standard Croatian is based on the most widespread dialect of
 Serbo-Croatian, Shtokavian, more specifically on Eastern
 Herzegovinian, which is also the basis of Standard Serbian, 
 Bosnian, and Montenegrin. In the mid-18th century, the first
 attempts to provide a Croatian literary standard began on the
 basis of the Neo-Shtokavian dialect that served as a 
 supraregional lingua franca pushing back regional Chakavian,
 Kajkavian, and Shtokavian vernaculars. The decisive role was 
 played by Croatian Vukovians, who cemented the usage of Ijekavian 
 Neo-Shtokavian as the literary standard in the late 
 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, in addition 
 to designing a phonological orthography. Croatian is 
 written in Gaj's Latin alphabet.</p>

 <p>Standard Croatian is the official language 
 of the Republic of Croatia and, along with 
 Standard Bosnian and Standard Serbian, one of 
 three official languages of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 It is also official in the regions of 
 Burgenland (Austria), Molise (Italy
 and Vojvodina (Serbia). Additionally, 
 it has co-official status 
 alongside Romanian in the communes of Carașova
 and Lupac, Romania. In these localities, 
 Croats or Krashovani make up the majority of the 
 population, and education, signage and access to 
 public administration and the justice system are 
 provided in Croatian, alongside Romanian. 
Croatian is officially used and taught at all the universities 
in Croatia, and at the University of Mostar in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina. </p>

<h1 class ="bg-light">Minority Languages in Croatia</h1>

The Constitution of Croatia in its preamble defines Croatia
 as a nation state of ethnic Croats, a country of traditionally
 present communities that the constitution recognizes as
 national minorities and a country of all its citizens. 
 National minorities explicitly enumerated and recognized 
 in the Constitution are Serbs, Czechs, Slovaks, Italians, 
 Hungarians, Jews, Germans, Austrians, Ukrainians, Rusyns, 
 Bosniaks, Slovenes, Montenegrins, Macedonians, Russians, 
 Bulgarians, Poles, Romani, Romanians, Turks, Vlachs and 
 Albanians. Article 12 of the constitution states that the 
 official language in Croatia is the Croatian language, but 
 also states that in some local governments another language and 
 Cyrillic or some other script can be introduced in official 
 use.

 <br/>
 <br/>
 
 The official use of minority languages is defined by 
 relevant national legislation and international conventions 
 and agreements which Croatia signed. The most important 
 national laws are Constitutional Act on the Rights of National 
 Minorities, Law on Use of Languages and Scripts of National 
 Minorities and The Law on Education in language and script 
 of national minorities. Relevant international agreements are 
 European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages and Framework 
 Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. 
 Certain rights were achieved through bilateral agreements 
 and international agreements such as Treaty of Osimo and 
 Erdut Agreement.
