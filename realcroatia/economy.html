Recently-released national accounts data revealed that the economy lost pace in the second quarter, albeit following an exceptionally robust first-quarter upturn. After logging the strongest expansion in over a decade in Q1, consumer spending softened amid slower wage growth and higher inflation in Q2. Similarly, fixed investment growth cooled, although remained strong nonetheless, while government expenditure picked up, cushioning the overall slowdown somewhat. Meanwhile, the external sector dragged on growth as exports waned amid a decline in merchandise shipments. Looking ahead, upbeat confidence in the services sector and improved sentiment in retail trade in July bode well for business activity at the start of Q3. In other news, the government announced a new round of tax cuts in late July aimed at young people as part of an effort to stem emigration. The measures are set to come into effect next year, which could provide a boost to disposable incomes.

Growth is seen shifting into a higher gear this year, underpinned by firm domestic demand. Healthy real wage growth, a tightening job market and tax relief measures should spur consumer spending, while continued absorption of EU structural funds should buoy investment activity. A slowing EU economy and tourism industry amid increased competition weigh on the outlook. FocusEconomics analysts expect growth of 2.9% in 2019, which is down 0.1 percentage points from last monthâ€™s forecast, and 2.5% in 2020.
