Croatia first appeared as two duchies in the 7th century, the 
Duchy of Croatia and the Duchy of Pannonian Croatia, which were
 united and elevated into the Kingdom of Croatia which lasted
 from 925 until 1918. From the 12th century the Kingdom of Croatia 
 entered a Personal Union with the Kingdom of Hungary, it remained
 a distinct state with its ruler (Ban) and Sabor, but it elected
 Royal dynasties from neighboring powers, primarily Hungary, Naples
 and Austria. The period from the 15th to the 17th centuries was
 marked by bitter struggles with the Ottoman Empire. After being 
 incorporated in Yugoslavia for most of the 20th century, Croatia 
 regained independence in 1991. 

<br/>
<br/>



The area known today as Croatia was inhabited 
throughout the prehistoric period. Fossils of 
Neanderthals dating to the middle Palaeolithic
 period have been unearthed in northern Croatia, 
 with the most famous and the best presented site in 
 Krapina. Remnants of several Neolithic and Chalcolithic 
 cultures were found in all regions of the country. The largest
 proportion of the sites is in the northern Croatia river valleys,
 and the most significant cultures whose presence was discovered
 include Starčevo, Vučedol and Baden cultures. The Iron Age left traces 
 of the early Illyrian Hallstatt culture and the Celtic La Tène culture. 
 Much later, the region was settled by Liburnians and Illyrians, while the 
 first Greek colonies were established on the Vis and Hvar islands.

 Dalmatia was the northern part of the Illyrian kingdom between 
 the 4th century BC until the Illyrian Wars in the 220s BC and 168
 BC when the Roman Republic established its protectorate south of
 the river Neretva. The area north of the Neretva was slowly 
 incorporated into Roman possession until the province of Illyricum 
 was formally established c. 32–27 BC. The Dalmatia region then
 became part of the Roman province of Illyricum. Between 6 and 9
 AD the Dalmatians raised the last in a series of revolts together
 with the Pannonians, but it was finally crushed and in 10 AD 
 Illyricum was split into two provinces, Pannonia and Dalmatia. 
 The province of Dalmatia spread inland to cover all of the Dinaric
 Alps and most of the eastern Adriatic coast.

 Dalmatia was the 
 birthplace of the Roman Emperor Diocletian, who, upon retirement
 from Emperor in AD 305, built a large palace near Salona, out of 
 which the city of Split later developed. Historians such as Theodore 
 Mommsen and Bernard Bavant argue that all Dalmatia was fully 
 romanized and Latin speaking by the 4th century. Others, such as 
 Aleksandar Stipčević, argue that the process of romanization was 
 rather selective and involved mostly urban centers but not the 
 countryside, where previous Illyrian socio-political structures
 were adapted to Roman administration and political structure
 only in some necessities.

Stanko Guldescu argued that the Vlachs, or Morlachs, were Latin 
speaking and pastoral peoples who lived in the Balkan mountains 
since pre-Roman times, and they are mentioned in the oldest Croatian 
chronicles After the Western Roman Empire collapsed in 476, with the 
beginning of the Migration Period, Julius Nepos shortly ruled his 
diminished domain from the Diocletian palace after his 476 flight 
from Italy. The region was then ruled by the Ostrogoths up to 535, 
when Justinian I added the territory to the Byzantine Empire. Later, 
the Byzantines formed the Theme of Dalmatia in the same territory. The 
Roman period ends with Avar and Croat invasions in the 6th and 7th centuries 
and the destruction of almost all Roman towns. Roman survivors retreated 
to more favourable sites on the coast, islands and mountains. The city of 
Ragusa was founded by such survivors from Epidaurum.  

 
 <br/>
 <br/>
 

 
 According to the work De Administrando Imperio written by the 
 10th-century Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, the Croats had 
 arrived in what is today Croatia, from southern Poland, south of 
 Kraków in the early 7th century, however that claim is disputed and 
 competing hypotheses date the event between the 6th and the 9th centuries. 
 Eventually two dukedoms were formed-Duchy of Pannonia and Duchy of Dalmatia, 
 ruled by Liudewit and Borna, as attested by chronicles of Einhard 
 starting in the year 818. The record represents the first document 
 of Croatian realms, vassal states of Francia at the time. The Frankish 
 overlordship ended during the reign of Mislav two decades later. According 
 to the Constantine VII christianization of Croats began in the 7th century, 
 but the claim is disputed and generally christianization is associated with 
 the 9th century. In 879, under duke Branimir, the duke of Croats, Dalmatian 
 Croatia received papal recognition as a state from Pope John VIII. 


<br/>
<br/>



Tomislav was the first ruler of Croatia who was styled a king in a 
letter from the Pope John X, dating kingdom of Croatia to year 925. 
Tomislav defeated Hungarian and Bulgarian invasions, spreading the 
influence of Croatian kings. The medieval Croatian kingdom reached 
its peak in the 11th century during the reigns of Petar Krešimir IV (1058–1074) 
and Dmitar Zvonimir (1075–1089). When Stjepan II died in 1091 ending the 
Trpimirović dynasty, Ladislaus I of Hungary claimed the Croatian crown. 
Opposition to the claim led to a war and personal union of Croatia and 
Hungary in 1102, ruled by Coloman.

The consequences of the change to the Hungarian king included the 
introduction of feudalism and the rise of the native noble families 
such as Frankopan and Šubić. The later kings sought to restore some 
of their previously lost influence by giving certain privileges to the 
towns. For the next four centuries, the Kingdom of Croatia was ruled by 
the Sabor (parliament) and a Ban (viceroy) appointed by the king. The 
princes of Bribir from the Šubić family became particularly influential,
 asserting control over large parts of Dalmatia, Slavonia and Bosnia. 
 Later, however, the Angevins intervened and restored royal power. The 
 period saw rise of native nobility such as the Frankopans and the Šubićs
 to prominence and ultimately numerous Bans from the two families.

 Separate coronation as King of Croatia was gradually allowed to fall into 
 abeyance and last crowned king is Charles Robert in 1301 after which Croatia
 contented herself with a separate diploma inaugurale. The reign of Louis the
 Great (1342–1382) is considered the golden age of Croatian medieval history. 
 Ladislaus of Naples also sold the whole of Dalmatia to Venice in 1409. The 
 period saw increasing threat of Ottoman conquest and struggle against the 
 Republic of Venice for control of coastal areas. The Venetians gained control
 over most of Dalmatia by 1428. With exception of the city-state of Dubrovnik 
 which became independent, the rule of Venice on most of Dalmatia will last nearly 
 four centuries (c. 1420 – 1797). In 1490 the estates of Croatia declined to recognize
 Vladislaus II until he had taken oath to respect their liberties, and insisted 
 upon his erasing from the diploma certain phrases which seemed to reduce Croatia 
 to the rank of a mere province. The dispute was solved in 1492.

As the Turkish incursion into Europe started, Croatia once again became a border 
area. The Croats fought an increasing number of battles and gradually lost increasing 
swathes of territory to the Ottoman Empire. Ottoman conquests led to the 1493 Battle of
 Krbava field and 1526 Battle of Mohács, both ending in decisive Ottoman victories. 
 King Louis II died at Mohács, and in November 1526, a Hungarian parliament elected
 János Szapolyai as the new king of Hungary. In December 1526, an other Hungarian
 parliament elected Ferdinand Habsburg as King of Hungary. On the other side, the 
 Croatian Parliament met in Cetin and chose Ferdinand I of the House of Habsburg as
 new ruler of Croatia, under the condition that he provide protection to Croatia 
 against the Ottoman Empire while respecting its political rights. A few years later 
 both crown would be again united in Habsburgs hands and the union would be restored. 
 The Ottoman Empire further expanded in the 16th century to include most of Slavonia, 
 western Bosnia (then called Turkish Croatia) and Lika. Ottoman Croatia initially was 
 part of Rumelia Eyalet, and later was parts of Budin Eyalet, Bosnia Eyalet and Kanije 
 Eyalet.

Later in the same century, Croatia was so weak that its parliament authorized Ferdinand
 Habsburg to carve out large areas of Croatia and Slavonia adjacent to the Ottoman Empire
 for the creation of the Military Frontier (Vojna Krajina, German: Militaergrenze) which 
 would be ruled directly from Vienna's military headquarters. The area became rather deserted
 and was subsequently settled by Serbs, Vlachs, Croats and Germans and others. As a result 
 of their compulsory military service to the Habsburg Empire during conflict with the Ottoman
 Empire, the population in the Military Frontier was free of serfdom and enjoyed much political 
 autonomy, unlike the population living in the parts ruled by Hungary.

After the Bihać fort finally fell in 1592, only small parts of Croatia remained unconquered. 
The Ottoman army was successfully repelled for the first time on the territory of Croatia 
following the battle of Sisak in 1593. The lost territory was partially restored, except for 
large parts of today's Bosnia and Herzegovina, Lika and Slavonia regions of present Croatia. 
By the 18th century, the Ottoman Empire was driven out of Hungary, and Austria brought the
 empire under central control. Empress Maria Theresa of Austria was supported by the 
 Croatians in the War of Austrian Succession of 1741–1748 and subsequently made significant 
 contributions to Croatian matters. With the fall of the Venetian Republic in 1797, its
 possessions in eastern Adriatic became subject to a dispute between France and Austria. 
 The Habsburgs eventually secured them (by 1815) and Dalmatia and Istria became part of 
 the empire, though they were in Cisleithania while Croatia and Slavonia were under 
 Hungary.

Croatian romantic nationalism emerged in the mid-19th century to counteract the 
apparent Germanization and Magyarization of Croatia. The Illyrian movement attracted 
a number of influential figures from the 1830s on, and produced some important 
advances in the Croatian language and culture. In the Revolutions of 1848 the Triune 
Kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia, driven by fear of Magyar nationalism, 
supported the Habsburg court against Hungarian revolutionary forces. However, despite 
the contributions of its ban Jelačić in quenching the Hungarian war of independence, 
Croatia, not treated any more favourably by Vienna than the Hungarians themselves, lost 
its domestic autonomy. In 1867 the Dual Monarchy was created; Croatian autonomy was restored 
in 1868 with the Croatian–Hungarian Settlement which was comparatively favourable for the 
Croatians, but still problematic because of issues such as the unresolved status of Rijeka. 
World War I brought an end to the Habsburg Empire. 


<br/>
<br/>



Croatia suffered great loss of life in the war, and while there was some late 
effort to establish a Croatian section of the Empire, ultimately the military 
defeat led to the establishment of a separate South Slavic state, which would 
later be named Yugoslavia. Shortly before the end of the First World War in 1918, 
the Croatian Parliament severed relations with Austria-Hungary as the Entente armies 
defeated those of the Habsburgs. Croatia and Slavonia became a part of the State of 
Slovenes, Croats and Serbs composed out of all Southern Slavic territories of the now 
former Austro-Hungarian Monarchy with a transitional government headed in Zagreb. 



<br/>
<br/>



The creation of Yugoslavia happened in late 1918: after Srijem left Croatia-Slavonia and 
joined Serbia together with Vojvodina, shortly followed by a referendum to join Bosnia and 
Herzegovina to Serbia, the People's Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (Narodno vijeće), 
guided by what was by that time a half a century long tradition of pan-Slavism and without sanction 
of the Croatian sabor, joined the Kingdom of Serbia into the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. 
Although the state inherited much of Austro-Hungary's military arsenal, including the entire fleet, 
the Kingdom of Italy moved rapidly to annex the state's most western territories, promised to her by
 the Treaty of London of 1915. An Italian Army eventually took Istria, started to annex the Adriatic 
 islands one by one, and even landed in Zadar. Partial resolution to the so-called Adriatic Question 
 would come in 1920 with the Treaty of Rapallo. 

<br/>
<br/>


The Kingdom underwent a crucial change in 1921 to the dismay of Croatia's largest political party, 
the Croatian Peasant Party (Hrvatska seljačka stranka). The new constitution abolished the 
historical/political entities, including Croatia and Slavonia, centralizing authority in the capital 
of Belgrade. The Croatian Peasant Party boycotted the government of the Serbian People's Radical Party 
throughout the period, except for a brief interlude between 1925 and 1927, when external Italian 
expansionism was at hand with her allies, Albania, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria that threatened 
Yugoslavia as a whole. In the early 1920s the Yugoslav government of Serbian prime minister Nikola
 Pasic used police pressure over voters and ethnic minorities, confiscation of opposition pamphlets 
 and other measures of election rigging to keep the opposition, and mainly the Croatian Peasant Party
 and its allies in minority in Yugoslav parliament. Pasic believed that Yugoslavia should be as centralized
 as possible, creating in place of distinct regional governments and identities a Greater Serbian national 
 concept of concentrated power in the hands of Belgrade. 

<br/>
<br/>


During a Parliament session in 1928, the Croatian Peasant Party's leader Stjepan Radić was
 mortally wounded by Puniša Račić, a deputy of the Serbian Radical People's Party, which 
 caused further upsets among the Croatian elite. In 1929, King Aleksandar proclaimed a 
 dictatorship and imposed a new constitution which, among other things, renamed the country
 the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The territory of Croatia was largely divided into the territories
 of the Sava and Littoral Banates. Political parties were banned from the start and the royal
 dictatorship took on an increasingly harsh character. Vladko Maček, who had succeeded Radić
 as leader of the Croatian Peasant Party, the largest political party in Croatia, was imprisoned, 
 and members of a newly emerging insurgent movement, the Ustaše, went into exile. According to the 
 British historian Misha Glenny the murder in March 1929 of Toni Schlegel, editor of a pro-Yugoslavian
 newspaper Novosti, brought a "furious response" from the regime. In Lika and west Herzegovina in 
 particular, which he described as "hotbeds of Croatian separatism," he wrote that the majority-Serb
 police acted "with no restraining authority whatsoever." 

<br/>
<br/>



In the words of a prominent Croatian writer, Shlegel's death became the pretext for terror in all 
forms. Politics was soon "indistinguishable from gangsterism." Even in this oppressive climate, few 
rallied to the Ustaša cause and the movement was never able to organise within Croatia. But its 
leaders did manage to convince the Communist Party that it was a progressive movement. The party's 
newspaper Proleter (December 1932) stated: "[We] salute the Ustaša movement of the peasants of Lika 
and Dalmatia and fully support them." In 1934, King Aleksandar was assassinated abroad, in Marseille, 
by a coalition of the Ustaše and a similarly radical movement, the Bulgarian VMORO. The Serbian-Croatian
 Cvetković-Maček government that came to power, distanced Yugoslavia's former allies of France and the
 United Kingdom, and moved closer to Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany in the period of 1935–1941. A 
 national Banovina of Croatia was created in 1939 out of the two Banates, as well as parts of the Zeta,
 Vrbas, Drina and Danube Banates. It had a reconstructed Croatian Parliament which would choose a Croatian
 Ban and Viceban. This Croatia included a part of Bosnia, most of Herzegovina and the city of Dubrovnik 
 and the surroundings. 
 
<br/>
<br/>



The Axis occupation of Yugoslavia in 1941 allowed the Croatian radical right Ustaše to come into power, 
forming the "Independent State of Croatia" (Nezavisna Država Hrvatska, NDH), led by Ante Pavelić, who
 assumed the role of Poglavnik. Following the pattern of other fascist regimes in Europe, the Ustashi 
 enacted racial laws, formed eight concentration camps targeting minority Serbs, Romas and Jewish 
 populations, as well as Croatian and Bosnian Muslim partisans. The biggest concentration camp was 
 Jasenovac in Croatia. The NDH had a program, formulated by Mile Budak, to purge Croatia of Serbs, 
 by "killing one third, expelling the other third and assimilating the remaining third". The main 
 targets for persecution were the Serbs, with approximately 330,000 were killed. 

<br/>
<br/>


The anti-fascist communist-led Partisan movement, based on pan-Yugoslav ideology, emerged in early 1941,
 under the command of Croatian-born Josip Broz Tito, spreading quickly into many parts of Yugoslavia. The
 1st Sisak Partisan Detachment, often hailed as the first armed anti-fascist resistance unit in occupied
 Europe, was formed in Croatia, in the Brezovica Forest near the town of Sisak. As the movement began to 
 gain popularity, the Partisans gained strength from Croats, Bosniaks, Serbs, Slovenes, and Macedonians 
 who believed in a unified, but federal, Yugoslav state.  


By 1943, the Partisan resistance movement had gained the upper hand, against the odds, and in 1945, with 
help from the Soviet Red Army (passing only through small parts such as Vojvodina), expelled the Axis 
forces and local supporters. The ZAVNOH, state anti-fascist council of people's liberation of Croatia, 
functioned since 1942 and formed an interim civil government by 1943. NDH's ministers of War and Internal
 Security Mladen Lorković and Ante Vokić tried to switch to Allied side.

Pavelić was in the beginning supporting them but when he found that he would need to leave his 
position he imprisoned them in Lepoglava prison where they were executed. Following the defeat of 
the Independent State of Croatia at the end of the war, a large number of Ustaše, civilians supporting 
them (ranging from sympathizers, young conscripts, anti-communists, and ordinary serfs who were motivated 
by Partisan atrocities), Chetniks and anti-Communists attempted to flee in the direction of Austria
 hoping to surrender to British forces and to be given refuge. They were instead interned by British
 forces and then returned to the Partisans. 


Croatia was a Socialist Republic part of a six-part Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia. 
Under the new communist system, privately owned factories and estates were nationalized, and the 
economy was based on a type of planned market socialism. The country underwent a rebuilding process, 
recovered from World War II, went through industrialization and started developing tourism. 



The country's socialist system also provided free apartments from big companies, which with the workers' 
self-management investments paid for the living spaces. From 1963, the citizens of Yugoslavia were allowed
 to travel to almost any country because of the neutral politics. No visas were required to travel to eastern
 or western countries, or to capitalist or communist nations. 

<br/>
<br/>


Such free travel was unheard of at the time in the Eastern Bloc countries, and in some western countries as 
well (e.g., Spain or Portugal, both dictatorships at the time). This proved to be very helpful for Croatia's 
inhabitants who found working in foreign countries more financially rewarding. Upon retirement, a popular plan
 was to return to live in Croatia (then Yugoslavia) to buy a more expensive property. 

 
In Yugoslavia, the people of Croatia were guaranteed free healthcare, free dental care, and secure pensions.
 The older generation found this very comforting as pensions would sometimes exceed their former paychecks.
 Free trade and travel within the country also helped Croatian industries that imported and exported 
 throughout all the former republics. 



Students and military personnel were encouraged to visit other republics to learn more about the 
country, and all levels of education, especially secondary education and higher education, were free.
 In reality the housing was inferior with poor heat and plumbing, the medical care often lacking even 
 in availability of antibiotics, schools were propaganda machines and travel was a necessity to provide
 the country with hard currency. The propagandists, who want people to believe "neutral policies" 
 equalized Serbs and Croats, severely restricted free speech and did not protect citizens from ethnic 
 attacks. 


Membership in the party was as much a prerequisite for admission to colleges and for government jobs
 as in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin or Nikita Khrushchev. Private sector businesses did not 
 grow as the taxes on private enterprise were often prohibitive. Inexperienced management sometimes 
 ruled policy and controlled decisions by brute force. Strikes were forbidden, owners/managers were 
 not permitted to make changes or decision which would impact their productivity or profit. 

<br/>
<br/>


The economy developed into a type of socialism called samoupravljanje (self-management), in 
which workers controlled socially owned enterprises. This kind of market socialism created 
significantly better economic conditions than in the Eastern Bloc countries. Croatia went 
through intensive industrialization in the 1960s and 1970s with industrial output increasing
 several-fold and with Zagreb surpassing Belgrade for the amount of industry. Factories and 
 other organizations were often named after Partisans who were declared national heroes. This 
 practice also spread to street names, names of parks and buildings, and some more trivial 
 features. 



Before World War II, Croatia's industry was not significant, with the vast majority of the 
people employed in agriculture. By 1991 the country was completely transformed into a modern 
industrialized state. By the same time, the Croatian Adriatic coast had taken shape as an 
internationally popular tourist destination, all coastal republics (but mostly SR Croatia) 
profited greatly from this, as tourist numbers reached levels still unsurpassed in modern 
Croatia. The government brought unprecedented economic and industrial growth, high levels 
of social security and a very low crime rate. The country completely recovered from WWII and 
achieved a very high GDP and economic growth rate, significantly higher than those of the
 present-day republic. 

<br/>
<br/>


The constitution of 1963 balanced the power in the country between the Croats and the Serbs and 
alleviated imbalance coming from the fact that the Croats were again in a minority position. 
Trends after 1965 (like the fall of OZNA and UDBA chief Aleksandar Ranković from power in 1966), 
however, led to the Croatian Spring of 1970–71, when students in Zagreb organized demonstrations 
to achieve greater civil liberties and greater Croatian autonomy. The regime stifled the public 
protest and incarcerated the leaders, but this led to the ratification of a new constitution in 
1974, giving more rights to the individual republics. At that time, radical Ustaše cells of Croatian 
émigrés in Western Europe planned and carried out guerilla acts inside Yugoslavia, but they were 
largely countered.  
 
 
  
 In 1980, after Tito's death, economic, political, and religious difficulties started to 
 mount and the federal government began to crumble. The crisis in Kosovo and, in 1986, the 
 emergence of Slobodan Milošević in Serbia provoked a very negative reaction in Croatia and 
 Slovenia; politicians from both republics feared that his motives would threaten their republics' 
 autonomy. With the climate of change throughout Eastern Europe during the 1980s, the communist 
 hegemony was challenged (at the same time, the Milošević government began to gradually concentrate 
 Yugoslav power in Serbia and calls for free multi-party elections were becoming louder). 


<br/>
<br/>



In June 1989 the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) was founded by Croatian nationalist 
dissidents led by Franjo Tuđman, a former fighter in Tito's Partisan movement and JNA 
General. At this time Yugoslavia was still a one-party state and open manifestations of
 Croatian nationalism were dangerous so a new party was founded in an almost conspiratorial
 manner. It was only on 13 December 1989 that the governing League of Communists of Croatia 
 agreed to legalize opposition political parties and hold free elections in the spring of 
 1990. 


On 23 January 1990 at its 14th Congress the Communist League of Yugoslavia voted to remove 
its monopoly on political power, but the same day effectively ceased to exist as a national
 party when the League of Communists of Slovenia walked out after Serbia's Slobodan Milošević
 blocked all their reformist proposals—the League of Communists of Croatia walked out soon 
 after. 
 
 
 On 22 April and 7 May 1990, the first free multi-party elections were held in 
 Croatia. Franjo Tuđman's Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) won by a 42% margin 
 against Ivica Račan's reformed communist Party of Democratic Change (SDP) who
 won 26%. However, Croatia's first-past-the-post election system enabled Tuđman
 to form the government relatively independently as the win translated into 205 
 mandates (out of 351 total). The HDZ's intentions were to secure independence 
 for Croatia, contrary to the wishes of a part of the ethnic Serbs in the republic,
 and federal politicians in Belgrade. The excessively polarized climate soon escalated 
 into complete estrangement between the two nations and spiralled into sectarian 
 violence.

On 25 July 1990, a Serbian Assembly was established in Srb, north of Knin, as the 
political representation of the Serbian people in Croatia. The Serbian Assembly declared
 "sovereignty and autonomy of the Serb people in Croatia". Their position was that if
 Croatia could secede from Yugoslavia, then the Serbs could secede from Croatia. 
 Milan Babić, a dentist from the southern town of Knin, was elected president. The
 rebel Croatian Serbs established a number of paramilitary militias under the 
 leadership of Milan Martić, the police chief in Knin. 

On 17 August 1990, the Serbs began what became known as the Log Revolution, where
 barricades of logs were placed across roads throughout the South as an expression
 of their secession from Croatia. This effectively cut Croatia in two, separating
 the coastal region of Dalmatia from the rest of the country. The Croatian government
 responded to the blockade of roads by sending special police teams in helicopters to
 the scene, but they were intercepted by SFR Yugoslav Air Force fighter jets and 
 forced to turn back to Zagreb. 


The Croatian constitution was passed in December 1990 categorizing Serbs
 as a minority group along with other ethnic groups. Babić's administration
 announced the creation of a Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina (or SAO Krajina)
 on 21 December 1990. Other Serb-dominated communities in eastern Croatia announced
 that they would also join SAO Krajina and ceased paying taxes to the Zagreb 
 government. 

<br/>
<br/>

On Easter Sunday, 31 March 1991, the first fatal clashes occurred when Croatian
 police from the Croatian Ministry of the Interior (MUP) entered the Plitvice
 Lakes national park to expel rebel Serb forces. Serb paramilitaries ambushed
 a bus carrying Croatian police into the national park on the road north of
 Korenica, sparking a day-long gun battle between the two sides. During the
 fighting, two people, one Croat and one Serb policeman, were killed. Twenty
 other people were injured and twenty-nine Krajina Serb paramilitaries and
 policemen were taken prisoner by Croatian forces. Among the prisoners was
 Goran Hadžić, later to become the President of the Republic of Serbian 
 Krajina. 



On 2 May 1991 the Croatian parliament voted to hold a referendum on 
independence. On 19 May 1991, on an almost 80% turnout, 93.24% voted 
for independence. Krajina boycotted the referendum. They held their own
 referendum a week earlier on 12 May 1991 in the territories they 
 controlled and voted to remain in Yugoslavia which the Croatian
 government did not recognize as valid. On 25 June 1991 the Croatian 
 Parliament declared independence from Yugoslavia. Slovenia declared 
 independence from Yugoslavia on the same day.  
 
 <br/>
 <br/>
 
 The civilian population fled the areas of armed conflict en masse: 
 generally speaking, hundreds of thousands of Croats moved away from 
 the Bosnian and Serbian border areas. In many places, masses of
 civilians were forced out by the Yugoslav National Army (JNA), 
 who consisted mostly of conscripts from Serbia and Montenegro, and 
 irregulars from Serbia, in what became known as ethnic 
 cleansing. 

 
The border city of Vukovar underwent a three-month siege – the Battle
 of Vukovar – during which most of the city was destroyed and a majority 
 of the population was forced to flee. The city fell to the Serbian forces 
 on 18 November 1991 and the Vukovar massacre occurred. 


Subsequent UN-sponsored cease-fires followed, and the warring parties 
mostly entrenched. The Yugoslav People's Army retreated from Croatia 
into Bosnia and Herzegovina where a new cycle of tensions were escalating:
 the Bosnian War was to start. During 1992 and 1993, Croatia also handled
 an estimated 700,000 refugees from Bosnia, mainly Bosnian Muslims. 



Armed conflict in Croatia remained intermittent and mostly on a small 
scale until 1995. In early August, Croatia embarked on Operation Storm.
 The Croatian attack quickly reconquered most of the territories from the
 Republic of Serbian Krajina authorities, leading to a mass exodus of the
 Serbian population. An estimated 90,000-200,000 Serbs fled shortly before,
 during and after the operation. 

<br/>
<br/>




As a result of this operation, a few months later the Bosnian war ended 
with the negotiation of the Dayton Agreement. A peaceful integration of 
the remaining Serbian-controlled territories in eastern Slavonia was 
completed in 1998 under UN supervision. The majority of the Serbs who 
fled from the former Krajina have not returned due to fears of ethnic 
violence, discrimination and property repossession problems, and the 
Croatian government has yet to achieve the conditions for full 
reintegration. 



According to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, around 125,000 
ethnic Serbs who fled the 1991–1995 conflict are registered as having 
returned to Croatia, of whom around 55,000 remain permanently. 



Croatia became a member of the Council of Europe in 1996. The years 1996 and 1997 
were a period of post-war recovery and improving economic conditions. However, in 
1998 and 1999 Croatia experienced an economic depression, which brought 
unemployment for thousands of citizens. The remaining part of former 
"Krajina", areas adjacent to FR Yugoslavia, negotiated a peaceful 
reintegration process with the Croatian government. The so-called Erdut 
Agreement made the area a temporary protectorate of the UN Transitional 
Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium. The area 
was formally re-integrated into Croatia by 1998. 


Franjo Tuđman's government started to lose popularity as it was criticized
 (among other things) for its involvement in suspicious privatization deals
 of the early 1990s as well as a partial international isolation. The country
 experienced a mild recession in 1998 and 1999. Tuđman died in 1999 and in the 
 early 2000 parliamentary elections, the nationalist Croatian Democratic Union 
 (HDZ) government was replaced by a center-left coalition under the Social Democratic 
 Party of Croatia, with Ivica Račan as prime minister.

</div>

</div>

</center>

At the same time, presidential elections were held which were won by a moderate, 
Stjepan Mesić. The new Račan government amended the constitution, changing the
 political system from a presidential system to a parliamentary system, transferring 
 most executive presidential powers from the president to the institutions of the
 parliament and the prime minister. The new government also started several large 
 building projects, including state-sponsored housing, more rebuilding efforts to 
 enable refugee return, and the building of the A1 highway. 

 
The country achieved notable economic growth during these years, while the 
unemployment rate would continue to rise until 2001 when it finally started 
falling. Croatia became a World Trade Organization (WTO) member in 2000 and 
started the Accession of Croatia to the European Union in 2003. 


In late 2003, new parliamentary elections were held and a reformed HDZ party won 
under the leadership of Ivo Sanader, who became prime minister. European accession
 was delayed by controversies over the extradition of army generals to the ICTY, 
 including the runaway Ante Gotovina. Sanader was reelected in the closely contested 
 2007 parliamentary election. Other complications continued to stall the EU 
 negotiating process, most notably Slovenia's blockade of Croatia's EU accession
 in 2008-2009. 
 
 <br/>
 <br/>
 
 
 In June 2009, Sanader abruptly resigned his post and named Jadranka 
 Kosor in his place. Kosor introduced austerity measures to counter the
 economic crisis and launched an anti-corruption campaign aimed at public
 officials. In late 2009, Kosor signed an agreement with Borut Pahor, the premier 
 of Slovenia, that allowed the EU accession to proceed. 

 
In the Croatian presidential election, 2009-2010, Ivo Josipović, the 
candidate of the SDP won a landslide victory. Sanader tried to come back
 into HDZ in 2010, but was then ejected, and USKOK soon had him arrested 
 on several corruption charges. As of 2012, his trial is ongoing. 

 
In 2011, the accession agreement was concluded, giving Croatia the all-clear 
to join. The Croatian parliamentary election, 2011 was held on 4 December 2011, 
and the Kukuriku coalition won. Following the ratification of the Treaty of 
Accession 2011 and the successful Croatian European Union membership referendum
, 2012, Croatia joined the EU on 1 July 2013. 


In the Croatian presidential election, 2014-15, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović went to
 become the first Croatian female President. The Croatian parliamentary election,
 2015 resulted in the victory of the Patriotic Coalition which formed a new government
 with the Bridge of Independent Lists. However, a vote of no confidence brought down
 the Cabinet of Tihomir Orešković. After the Croatian parliamentary election, 2016, the Cabinet
 of Andrej Plenković was formed.
