The politics of Croatia are defined by a parliamentary, 
representative democratic republic framework, where the Prime 
Minister of Croatia is the head of government in a multi-party system.
 Executive power is exercised by the Government and the President of 
 Croatia. Legislative power is vested in the Croatian Parliament 
 (Croatian: Sabor). The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the 
 legislature. The parliament adopted the current Constitution of Croatia on 
 22 December 1990 and decided to declare independence from Yugoslavia on 25 
 May 1991. The Constitutional Decision on the Sovereignty and Independence of 
 the Republic of Croatia came into effect on 8 October 1991. The constitution 
 has since been amended several times. The first modern parties in the country
 developed in the middle of the 19th century, and their agenda and appeal 
 changed, reflecting major social changes, such as the breakup of Austria-Hungary, 
 the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, dictatorship and social upheavals in the 
 kingdom, World War II, the establishment of Communist rule and the 
 breakup of the SFR Yugoslavia.

 Croatia is a unitary democratic parliamentary republic. Following the
 collapse of the ruling Communist League, Croatia adopted a new constitution
 in 1990 – which replaced the 1974 constitution adopted by the Socialist 
 Republic of Croatia – and organised its first multi-party elections. 
 While the 1990 constitution remains in force, it has been amended four 
 times since its adoption—in 1997, 2000, 2001 and 2010. Croatia
 declared independence from Yugoslavia on 8 October 1991, which led to
 the breakup of Yugoslavia. Croatia's status as a country was internationally 
 recognised by the United Nations in 1992. Under its 1990 constitution, 
 Croatia operated a semi-presidential system until 2000 when it switched to a 
 parliamentary system. Government powers in Croatia are divided into legislative, 
 executive and judiciary powers. The legal system of Croatia is civil law and, 
 along with the institutional framework, is strongly influenced by the legal heritage 
 of Austria-Hungary. By the time EU accession negotiations were completed on 30 June 
 2010, Croatian legislation was fully harmonised with the Community acquis. Croatia became
 a member state of the European Union on 1 July 2013.

The President of the Republic (Croatian: Predsjednik/ica Republike) 
is the head of state; he or she is directly elected and serves a five-year
 term. The president is the commander in chief of the armed forces, has the 
 procedural duty of appointing the prime minister with the consent of the Sabor 
 (Parliament) through a majority vote (majority of all MPs), and has some influence 
 on foreign policy. The most recent presidential election was held on 11 January 
 2015 and was won by Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović. She took the oath of office on
 15 February 2015. The constitution limits holders of the presidential office to
 a maximum of two terms and prevents the president from being a member of any 
 political party. Consequently, the president-elect withdraws from party
 membership before inauguration. 

 
 <br/>
 <br/>
 
 
 
 
 The Parliament of Croatia (Croatian: Sabor) is a unicameral 
 legislative body. A second chamber, the Chamber of Counties 
 (Croatian: Županijski dom), was set up in 1993 pursuant to the 
 1990 Constitution. The Chamber of Counties was originally composed 
 of three deputies from each of the twenty counties and the city of 
 Zagreb. However, as it had no practical power over the Chamber of 
 Representatives, it was abolished in 2001 and its powers were transferred 
 to the county governments. The number of Sabor representatives can vary 
 from 100 to 160; they are all elected by popular vote and serve four-year 
 terms. 140 members are elected in multi-seat constituencies, up to six members 
 are chosen by proportional representation to represent Croatians living abroad and
 five members represent ethnic and national communities or minorities.
 

 <br/>
 <br/>
 
 
 Croatia has a three-tiered, independent judicial system governed by the 
 constitution and national legislation enacted by the Sabor. The Supreme 
 Court (Croatian: Vrhovni sud) is the highest court of appeal in Croatia; 
 its hearings are open and judgments are made publicly, except in cases where
 the privacy of the accused is to be protected. Judges are appointed by the
 National Judicial Council and judicial office is permanent until seventy years
 of age. The president of the Supreme Court is elected for a four-year term by 
 the Croatian Parliament at the proposal of the President of the Republic. As of
 2017, the president of the Supreme Court is Đuro Sessa. The Supreme Court 
 has civil and criminal departments. The lower two levels of the three-tiered 
 judiciary consist of county courts and municipal courts. There are fifteen county 
 courts and sixty-seven municipal courts in the country.
