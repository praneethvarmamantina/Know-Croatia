Croatia officially the Republic of Croatia, is a country 
at the crossroads of Central and Southeast Europe, on the
 Adriatic Sea. It borders Slovenia to the northwest, 
 Hungary to the northeast, Serbia to the east, Bosnia 
 and Herzegovina, and Montenegro to the southeast, sharing 
 a maritime border with Italy. Its capital, Zagreb, forms
 one of the country's primary subdivisions, along with 
 twenty counties. Croatia has an area of 56,594 square 
 kilometres (21,851 square miles) and a population of
 4.28 million, most of whom are Roman Catholics and
 ethnic Croats. 

 <br/>
 <br/>
 
 
 
Inhabited since the Paleolithic Age, the Croats 
arrived in the area in the 6th century and organised 
the territory into two duchies by the 9th century.
 Croatia was first internationally recognized as 
 an independent state on 7 June 879 during the
 reign of duke Branimir. Tomislav became the 
 first king by 925, elevating Croatia to the
 status of a kingdom, which retained its
 sovereignty for nearly two centuries. 
 During the succession crisis after the
 Trpimirović dynasty ended, Croatia 
 entered a personal union with Hungary 
 in 1102. In 1527, faced with Ottoman
 conquest, the Croatian Parliament elected
 Ferdinand I of Austria to the Croatian
 throne. 
 
 <br/>
 <br/>
 
 The sovereign state of Croatia is a republic 
 governed under a parliamentary system and a 
 developed country with a very high standard of 
 living. It is a member of the European Union (EU),
 the United Nations (UN), the Council of Europe, 
 NATO, the World Trade Organization (WTO), and a 
 founding member of the Union for the Mediterranean.
 As an active participant in the UN peacekeeping forces,
 Croatia has contributed troops to the NATO-led mission in 
 Afghanistan and took a non-permanent seat on the UN 
 Security Council for the 2008–2009 term. Since 2000, 
 the Croatian government has constantly invested in
 infrastructure, especially transport routes and
 facilities along the Pan-European corridors. 
 
 <br/>
 <br/>
 
 
 
 Croatia's economy is dominated by service and
 industrial sectors and agriculture. Tourism is 
 a significant source of revenue, with Croatia 
 ranked among the top 20 most popular tourist
 destinations in the world. The state controls 
 a part of the economy, with substantial government
 expenditure. Croatia is located in Central and 
 Southeast Europe, on the coast of the Adriatic 
 Sea. It borders Hungary to the northeast, Serbia 
 to the east, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro 
 to the southeast, and Slovenia to the northwest. It
 lies mostly between latitudes 42° and 47° N and longitudes 
 13° and 20° E. Part of the territory in the extreme
 south surrounding Dubrovnik is a practical exclave 
 connected to the rest of the mainland by territorial
 waters, but separated on land by a short coastline
 strip belonging to Bosnia and Herzegovina around Neum. 

 
 <br/>
 <br/>
 
 
 

The territory covers 56,594 square kilometres 
(21,851 square miles), consisting of 56,414 square
 kilometres (21,782 square miles) of land and 128 square 
 kilometres (49 square miles) of water. It
 is the 127th largest country in the world. Elevation ranges 
 from the mountains of the Dinaric Alps with the highest point
 of the Dinara peak at 1,831 metres (6,007 feet) near the border
 with Bosnia and Herzegovina in the south to the shore of 
 the Adriatic Sea which makes up its entire southwest border. 
 Insular Croatia consists of over a thousand islands and islets 
 varying in size, 48 of which are permanently inhabited. The 
 largest islands are Cres and Krk, each of them having an area of 
 around 405 square kilometres (156 square miles). The hilly northern 
 parts of Hrvatsko Zagorje and the flat plains of Slavonia in the 
 east which is part of the Pannonian Basin are traversed by major 
 rivers such as Danube, Drava, Kupa, and Sava. 

 
 <br/>
 <br/>
 
 
 
 
The Danube, Europe's second longest river, runs through the 
city of Vukovar in the extreme east and forms part of the 
border with Vojvodina. The central and southern regions near 
the Adriatic coastline and islands consist of low mountains and 
forested highlands. Natural resources found in the country in 
quantities significant enough for production include oil, coal, 
bauxite, low-grade iron ore, calcium, gypsum, natural asphalt, 
silica, mica, clays, salt, and hydropower. Karst topography makes 
up about half of Croatia and is especially prominent in the Dinaric 
Alps. There are a number of deep caves in Croatia, 49 of which are 
deeper than 250 m (820.21 ft), 14 of them deeper than 500 m (1,640.42 ft) 
and three deeper than 1,000 m (3,280.84 ft). Croatia's most famous lakes 
are the Plitvice lakes, a system of 16 lakes with waterfalls connecting 
them over dolomite and limestone cascades.
