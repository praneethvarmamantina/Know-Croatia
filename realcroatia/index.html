Croatia officially the Republic of Croatia, is a country 
at the crossroads of Central and Southeast Europe, on the
 Adriatic Sea. It borders Slovenia to the northwest, 
 Hungary to the northeast, Serbia to the east, Bosnia 
 and Herzegovina, and Montenegro to the southeast, sharing 
 a maritime border with Italy. Its capital, Zagreb, forms
 one of the country's primary subdivisions, along with 
 twenty counties. Croatia has an area of 56,594 square 
 kilometres (21,851 square miles) and a population of
 4.28 million, most of whom are Roman Catholics and
 ethnic Croats. 

 <br/>
 <br/>
 
 
 
Inhabited since the Paleolithic Age, the Croats 
arrived in the area in the 6th century and organised 
the territory into two duchies by the 9th century.
 Croatia was first internationally recognized as 
 an independent state on 7 June 879 during the
 reign of duke Branimir. Tomislav became the 
 first king by 925, elevating Croatia to the
 status of a kingdom, which retained its
 sovereignty for nearly two centuries. 
 During the succession crisis after the
 Trpimirović dynasty ended, Croatia 
 entered a personal union with Hungary 
 in 1102. In 1527, faced with Ottoman
 conquest, the Croatian Parliament elected
 Ferdinand I of Austria to the Croatian
 throne.

 The sovereign state of Croatia is a republic 
 governed under a parliamentary system and a 
 developed country with a very high standard of 
 living. It is a member of the European Union (EU),
 the United Nations (UN), the Council of Europe, 
 NATO, the World Trade Organization (WTO), and a 
 founding member of the Union for the Mediterranean.
 As an active participant in the UN peacekeeping forces,
 
 
 Croatia has contributed troops to the NATO-led mission in 
 Afghanistan and took a non-permanent seat on the UN 
 Security Council for the 2008–2009 term. Since 2000, 
 the Croatian government has constantly invested in
 infrastructure, especially transport routes and
 facilities along the Pan-European corridors. 
 
 <br/>
 <br/>
 
 
 
 
 Croatia's economy is dominated by service and
 industrial sectors and agriculture. Tourism is 
 a significant source of revenue, with Croatia 
 ranked among the top 20 most popular tourist
 destinations in the world. The state controls 
 a part of the economy, with substantial government
 expenditure. Croatia is located in Central and 
 Southeast Europe, on the coast of the Adriatic 
 Sea. It borders Hungary to the northeast, Serbia 
 to the east, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro 
 to the southeast, and Slovenia to the northwest. It
 lies mostly between latitudes 42° and 47° N and longitudes 
 13° and 20° E. Part of the territory in the extreme
 south surrounding Dubrovnik is a practical exclave 
 connected to the rest of the mainland by territorial
 waters, but separated on land by a short coastline
 strip belonging to Bosnia and Herzegovina around Neum.

The territory covers 56,594 square kilometres 
(21,851 square miles), consisting of 56,414 square
 kilometres (21,782 square miles) of land and 128 square 
 kilometres (49 square miles) of water. It
 is the 127th largest country in the world. Elevation ranges 
 from the mountains of the Dinaric Alps with the highest point
 of the Dinara peak at 1,831 metres (6,007 feet) near the border
 with Bosnia and Herzegovina in the south to the shore of 
 the Adriatic Sea which makes up its entire southwest border. 
 Insular Croatia consists of over a thousand islands and islets 
 varying in size, 48 of which are permanently inhabited. The 
 largest islands are Cres and Krk, each of them having an area of 
 around 405 square kilometres (156 square miles). The hilly northern 
 parts of Hrvatsko Zagorje and the flat plains of Slavonia in the 
 east which is part of the Pannonian Basin are traversed by major 
 rivers such as Danube, Drava, Kupa, and Sava. 
 
<br/>
<br/>





  
 
The Danube, Europe's second longest river, runs through the 
city of Vukovar in the extreme east and forms part of the 
border with Vojvodina. The central and southern regions near 
the Adriatic coastline and islands consist of low mountains and 
forested highlands. Natural resources found in the country in 
quantities significant enough for production include oil, coal, 
bauxite, low-grade iron ore, calcium, gypsum, natural asphalt, 
silica, mica, clays, salt, and hydropower. Karst topography makes 
up about half of Croatia and is especially prominent in the Dinaric 
Alps. There are a number of deep caves in Croatia, 49 of which are 
deeper than 250 m (820.21 ft), 14 of them deeper than 500 m (1,640.42 ft) 
and three deeper than 1,000 m (3,280.84 ft). Croatia's most famous lakes 
are the Plitvice lakes, a system of 16 lakes with waterfalls connecting 
them over dolomite and limestone cascades.

 The name of Croatia derives from Medieval Latin Croātia.
 Itself a derivation of North-West Slavic *Xrovat-, by liquid 
 metathesis from Common Slavic period *Xorvat, from proposed
 Proto-Slavic *Xъrvátъ which possibly comes from Old Persian
 *xaraxwat-. The word is attested by the Old Iranian toponym Harahvait- 
 which is the native name of Arachosia. 
The origin of the name is uncertain, but is thought to be a Gothic or
 Indo-Aryan term assigned to a Slavic tribe. The oldest preserved 
 record of the Croatian ethnonym *xъrvatъ is of variable stem, attested 
 in the Baška tablet in style zvъnъmirъ kralъ xrъvatъskъ ("Zvonimir, Croatian king"). 
The first attestation of the Latin term is attributed to a charter of Duke Trpimir
 from the year 852. The original is lost, and just a 1568 copy is preserved, 
 leading to doubts over the authenticity of the claim. The oldest preserved stone
 inscription is the 9th-century Branimir Inscription found near Benkovac, 
 where Duke Branimir is styled Dux Cruatorvm. The inscription is not believed 
 to be dated accurately, but is likely to be from during the period of 879–892,
 during Branimir's rule.

Croatia can be subdivided between a number of ecoregions
 because of its climate and geomorphology. The country is 
 consequently one of the richest in Europe in terms of
 biodiversity. There are four types of biogeographical
 regions in Croatia—Mediterranean along the coast and 
 in its immediate hinterland, Alpine in most of Lika and
 Gorski Kotar, Pannonian along Drava and Danube, and continental 
 in the remaining areas. One of the most significant are karst habitats 
 which include submerged karst, such as Zrmanja and Krka canyons and 
 tufa barriers, as well as underground habitats. 

<br/>
<br/>

 
 
The karst geology harbours approximately 7,000 caves and pits, 
some of which are the habitat of the only known aquatic 
cave vertebrate—the olm. Forests are also significantly present 
in the country, as they cover 2,490,000 hectares (6,200,000 acres) 
representing 44% of Croatian land surface. Other habitat types include 
wetlands, grasslands, bogs, fens, scrub habitats, coastal and marine habitats.
 In terms of phytogeography, Croatia is a part of the Boreal Kingdom and is
 a part of Illyrian and Central European provinces of the Circumboreal 
 Region and the Adriatic province of the Mediterranean Region. The World 
 Wide Fund for Nature divides Croatia between three ecoregions—Pannonian 
 mixed forests, Dinaric Mountains mixed forests and Illyrian deciduous forests.

There are 37,000 known species in Croatia, but their 
actual number is estimated to be between 50,000 and 100,000.
 The claim is supported by nearly 400 new taxa of invertebrates 
 discovered in Croatia in the first half of the 2000s alone.
 There are more than a thousand endemic species, especially in 
 Velebit and Biokovo mountains, Adriatic islands and karst rivers. 
 Legislation protects 1,131 species. The most serious threat to species 
 is loss and degradation of habitats. A further problem is presented by 
 invasive alien species, especially Caulerpa taxifolia algae. 

 <br/>
 <br/>
 
 The invasive algae are regularly monitored and removed to 
 protect the benthic habitat. Indigenous sorts of cultivated 
 plants and breeds of domesticated animals are also numerous. 
 Those include five breeds of horses, five breeds of cattle, 
 eight breeds of sheep, two breeds of pigs, and a poultry breed. 
 Even the indigenous breeds include nine endangered or critically 
 endangered ones. There are 444 protected areas of Croatia, encompassing 
 9% of the country. Those include eight national parks, two strict reserves,
 and ten nature parks. The most famous protected area and the oldest 
 national park in Croatia is the Plitvice Lakes National Park, a UNESCO 
 World Heritage Site. Velebit Nature Park is a part of the UNESCO Man and 
 the Biosphere Programme. The strict and special reserves, as well as the 
 national and nature parks, are managed and protected by the central 
 government, while other protected areas are managed by counties. In 
 2005, the National Ecological Network was set up, as the first step 
 in the preparation of the EU accession and joining of the Natura 2000 network.
